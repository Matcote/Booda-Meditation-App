# Booda Meditation App

## Description

Booda is a social media based around meditation. You can use the timer to time/record your session, and then upload a comment and/or image along with it if you wish. There is also a Home/Feed page where you can see all of the people you follow's meditation sessions, give them a thumbs up, and comment on their post. Finally, there is a profile page where you can see your total stats, along with graphs, achievements, and monthly challenges you can participate in. See below for previews of all of this and more!

The front end was built using React.js. The back end was built using Node.js, using MongoDB as the database. Although this app was built using React for the web, it was made with mobile in mind. I intend to learn a mobile language in the near future and re-create this app for real, bigger and better.

## Demo

This app is live! Find it at https://booda-app.herokuapp.com
Use the email 'test@test.com' and the password 'test' so that you can have the full experience. This user has a bunch of friends, posts and stats so that you may see all features of the app.

A video of me presenting the app can also be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0oqW3RD2DM
